**Key Features:**

* **Image processing:** Preprocessing steps like resizing, noise reduction, and color space conversion enhance features for accurate analysis.
* **Feature extraction:** A comprehensive set of features, including shape, texture, and color attributes, are extracted from the processed images to capture disease-specific signatures.
* **Model training and evaluation:** traditional machine learning models Random Forest trained and evaluated for disease classification accuracy.
* **User-friendly interface:** A web application built with Streamlit provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload images and receive real-time disease predictions.
* **Visual explanations:** The app showcases the image processing steps and feature extraction methods used for prediction, promoting transparency and understanding.

**Benefits:**

* **Early disease detection:** Enables farmers to identify diseases at early stages, facilitating timely interventions and minimizing yield losses.
* **Improved accuracy:** Traditional machine learning models offer reliable and interpretable results, making them well-suited for real-world applications.
* **User-friendly interface:** Streamlit app provides a readily accessible platform for farmers without requiring technical expertise.
